<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October&nbsp;14,&nbsp;2025</p>

<p><strong>My Dream Notebook</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy.  
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application <em>My Dream Notebook</em>.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dream Entries:</strong> Dreams, notes, and reflections you enter are stored locally on your device using Apple’s Core Data. They are never uploaded to any server.</li>
  <li><strong>AI Interpretations:</strong> When you request an AI dream interpretation, your dream text is temporarily sent to the Gemini API (Google AI service) to generate a response. We do not store or reuse this data.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertisements:</strong> The App uses Google AdMob to display rewarded ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and limited data (e.g., IP address, device type) to deliver ads. If you deny tracking permission via App Tracking Transparency, only non-personalized ads are shown.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchases:</strong> If you buy a Premium subscription, Apple processes your payment securely through the App Store. We have no access to your billing information.</li>
  <li><strong>App Usage:</strong> Anonymous analytics (such as crash reports) may be collected to improve stability and performance. These contain no personally identifiable information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To provide AI dream interpretations upon user request.</li>
  <li>To show relevant (or non-personalized) ads via AdMob.</li>
  <li>To process and validate Premium subscriptions using StoreKit.</li>
  <li>To improve app quality and fix bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>Your dream data and notes remain on your device. Deleting the App removes all stored dreams.  
Back up your device if you want to keep your entries.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

</ul>

<h2>5. Tracking Transparency (ATT)</h2>
<p>When you first open the App, you’ll be asked whether you allow tracking across apps and websites for ad personalization.  
You can change this anytime in Settings → Privacy → Tracking.  
If you decline, AdMob will show only non-personalized ads.</p>

<h2>6. Subscriptions & Purchases</h2>
<p><em>My Dream Notebook</em> offers optional Premium subscriptions. Payments are processed by Apple and subject to App Store terms.  
Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.  
You can manage or cancel them in your App Store account settings.</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p><em>My Dream Notebook</em> is not directed to children under 13 years old, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  
If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has submitted information, contact us and we’ll delete it promptly.</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Because no data is stored on external servers, you can manage your information directly on your device.  
To delete all data, simply remove the App. For other privacy requests, contact us below.</p>

<h2>9. Ad Personalization Opt-out</h2>
<p>Users can opt out of personalized ads at any time by visiting Google’s Ads Settings page below:</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. The “Effective Date” above will be revised when changes occur.  
Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance.</p>
